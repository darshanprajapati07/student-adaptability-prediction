#  Student Adaptability Level Prediction in Online Learning using Machine Learning

##  Overview

This project aims to predict the **adaptability level of students** in online learning environments using supervised machine learning techniques. With the transition to online education during the COVID-19 pandemic, understanding how students adapt to this new mode of learning has become essential. By analyzing various socio-academic and behavioral factors, this project classifies students into adaptability levels: **Low**, **Moderate**, or **High**.

The goal is to assist educational institutions and e-learning platforms in identifying students who may require additional support, enabling personalized learning approaches and improved outcomes.


##  Objectives

- Understand the key factors affecting students' adaptability in online education.
- Develop machine learning models to predict adaptability levels.
- Evaluate and compare model performance using standard metrics.
- Provide actionable insights to educators and policymakers.


##  Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

- Gender  
- Age group  
- Education level  
- Internet access quality  
- Device availability  
- Learning environment  
- Self-learning capability  
- Emotional stability  
- Time management  
- Academic performance indicators  

The target variable is the **Student Adaptability Level** (Low / Moderate / High).

##  Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x  
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – Data processing
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Visualization
